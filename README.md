Node.js API Playground
Introduction

Welcome to the Node.js API Playground â€“ an extensive repository designed to explore fundamental backend API functionalities while prioritizing robust web security practices. This project serves as both a practical application and an educational resource, offering hands-on implementations for secure coding in Node.js development.

Google Authentication through OAuth
Experience seamless Google Authentication with OAuth, providing users with a convenient and secure way to access the API.

User Registration and Login System
A robust user registration and login system is in place, featuring secure password handling practices to ensure the confidentiality of user credentials.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Integration   
The API leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless and secure authentication. This enhances the overall security of the application while facilitating efficient user management.

Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers
The implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) headers fortifies the application against common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). This proactive approach helps create a more resilient and secure web environment.

Organized Middleware Stack
The middleware stack is thoughtfully organized to efficiently handle various aspects of API development. This includes streamlined processes for authentication, request validation, and other critical tasks, contributing to the overall performance and maintainability of the application.
