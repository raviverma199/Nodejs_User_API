Welcome to the Node.js API Playground, a comprehensive repository that delves into fundamental backend API functionalities while prioritizing robust web security practices. This project serves as an educational resource, offering practical implementations for secure coding in Node.js development. Key features include seamless Google Authentication through OAuth, a robust user registration and login system with secure password handling, and the integration of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless and secure authentication within the API. The implementation of Content Security Policy (CSP) headers further fortifies the application against common web vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The middleware stack is thoughtfully organized to efficiently handle authentication, request validation, and other critical tasks.
